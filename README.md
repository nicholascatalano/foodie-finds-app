  ## Description
  
  Foodie finds was created to help people who are looking for restaurants that cater to their specific dietary needs. This app has a minimalist design and a user-friendly interface with a clear navigational structure that makes it easy to use. The user will be able to add their own review for a restaurant they've visted which will be saved to their account dashboard, as well as see other reviews of restaurants based off their filters.

  This app was created using HTML5, CSS, front-end JavaScript, node.js with backend JavaScript, MySQL databate, and sequelize. This app uses an external API for TripAdvisor content.
